The behavioral, scheduling, routing, and other data obtained is stored by the car seat system and utilized to enhance the safety and comfortability of the child during a car ride. The car seat system also determines thickness of clothing worn by the child while placed in the car seat and adjusts the shoulder belts to accommodate for the clothing while providing a snug fit of the shoulder belts that fall within safety recommendations. The car seat also auto reclines to a desired angle and also rotates about itself to face the door. The car seat system includes an auto-incident detection mode. In this mode, the system detects an incident, such as an accident, hard braking, or another hazard, and automatically displaces the features in the car seat to make the car seat secure during the crash minimizing the effect of the incident on the child. The car seat also includes pretionsioners and motors to release, pull back, and lock the car seat belts.",5418040002108

The carrier includes at least one coil spring (128) held captive in compression between two spaced apart brackets (130, 132), one of which is pivotally connected to the end of the link adjacent the slide. The point of pivotal attachment of the link to the scissor arm is spaced from the linkage pivot to create a moment about the pivot tending to resist collapse of the linkage when force from the spring is communicated to the linkage. To adjust suspension weight resistance, the brackets (130, 132) are in communication with a rod (134) attached to a knob that is rotated to changing the distance between the brackets thereby changing the amount by which the spring is compressed. To change seat height, another knob is rotated to move the rod (134), springs (128), and brackets (130, 132) in unison toward or away from the front of the suspension causing the linkage to controllably expand or collapse. By this suspension construction, weight adjustment is advantageously substantially independent of height adjustment.  ",1703038000348

In such an automatic seat positioning device of the construction described above, a seat position detector (101a to 101f) corresponding to the seat member detects that the seat member has arrived at a specific position at which the detector is located and a preset control circuit presets a counter, which normally provides an indication of the position of the seat member by counting the number of rotations of the motor, to a value corresponding to the number of rotations of the motor by which the seat member is moved from an initial starting position to the specific position. In this errors of the counter due to slip which occurs whenever the motor is started and stopped, and engaged with the electromagnetic clutch will be cancelled. In addition, the automatic seat positioning device stores the positional data of the seat member set at the desired position from the counted value of the counter in a memory provided therewith in order to return the current set position of the seat member to an originally set position on a basis of the stored data.
